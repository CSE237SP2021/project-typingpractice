## Iteration 2
### What user stories were completed this iteration?
In this Iteration 2, we have created a new game mode for users to take advantage of in order to further develop their typing skills. The user stories completed include giving the option for a hard game mode where: 
- user is given a set amount of time to answer each word(when surpassed game will end)
- ending the game immediately after the user enters a word incorrectly
- creating a new text file with gradually increasing word lengths
- fixing the run script
- fixing the saved game recall mechanism
### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
In the next iteration, we plan on adding a third game mode, fixing our tests for the hard game mode, allow user to log out/switch accounts, keep track of overall highest scores, and cleaning up our code.
### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
Everything should work besides the tests for the hard game mode which we will address in the next iteration.
### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line?
./run.sh
